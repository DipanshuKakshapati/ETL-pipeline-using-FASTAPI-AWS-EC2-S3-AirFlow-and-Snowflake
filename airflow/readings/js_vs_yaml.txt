Yaml first reads all the data and then tries to seperate the data type. 
This is the reason why yaml file is not used that often in comparision to json files.

We use json for exchange of data between multiple computers.
We use yaml files for mainly configurations.

Example:

json file:

{
    "name": "The Ultimate Docker Guide",
    "price": 169,
    "is_published": true,
    "tags": ["software", "devops"],
    "author": {
        "first_name": "Mosh",
        "last_name": "Hamedani"
    }
}

yaml file:

---

name: The Ultimate Docker Guide
price: 169
is_published: true
tags:
    - software
    - devops
author:
    first_name: Mosh
    last_name: Hamedani
